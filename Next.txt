Problem in The Sync Data Orderr
still failed in the api (check it)
------------
The Current Problem is on progress
last code
    - Create Category function(Insert,Remove,Get) in ProductLocalDataSource
    - Because Now Category is not String but a model, i change the insertProductToLocal. 
    in Product.toLocalMap, i modify category to category.name,
    - add_product_page.dart still error until we finish this problem, cause the type data used on that 
    page is String for Category while now the type is Category

New Update
    - i think we should change the api instead, so instead of sending category model inside productResource
    lest modify the ProductResource in the laravel side so its only gonna send string instead of model
    - i did it, so now try run it as usual, the old code
    
WATCH THE WHOLE VIDEO FIRST, FIND OUT THE PURPOSE WHY Mr.BAHRI TRY TO SAVE CATEGORY DATA TO LOCAL
IF ITS ONLY FOR THE ADD DATA PRODCUT WHIC IS REQURING THE LIST OF CATGEORIES THEN USE ONLY THE CATEGORIES API

LAST FOLLOW VIDEO (1:25:00)

So i'v watch it, and the purpose is
    - in sync data page, he added button for sync category, which saving the list of categories data to LOCAL
    and that data is used in:
        - displaying list menuButton
===================
i think for productCard which we placed the category name in it, we can use the old method
- now for the list menuButton then we use bahri method, which save to local first then use for menuList
